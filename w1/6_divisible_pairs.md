### Figuring it out

7:43 am

Mathspeak detacted from reality is hard for me to process. It is not unfathomable, but it is alien. I overcome this by writing by hand in my notebook.


In a nutshell, this is a variation of

* in list return count of function true
* function composed of dynamic parts

It would be easy to dive into a for x do y count this do that, but if that not this then other thing. That would be unclean and would lead to pain (which I suspect is the trap)

A neater way is to use map because you have a clear blackbox function, with clear input and a clear return. You don't care what goes on in order to get the results.

the return value then essentially boils down to counting the amount of truthy values in the list.

Lets do that then

8:15am.

8:20am - the use of `i` and `j` is a pretty big hint that the blackbox is a double nested forloop.

8:49am - still working on this. At this point the interview is long gone and I'm in a world of pain.  Thanks for coming in and we'll be in touch kinda thing.

09:00am - it is the looping that is causing me to crash here, I know the answer is simple. Dear neural pathways -> awaken.


9:16am - I have the results, but I do not have the feeling that I should be doing something with yield for a cleaner result. For now I think I can use a holding list and return that. 


09:22am - three tests are passing, but i now need to get the constraints in. Also, map is no where to be found


9:31am abort - need to go plant those trees!


17:00 - back from tree planting. Spade snapped. Doh.


# 22:00 - next day. I was massively over thinking this. It was not as complex as I was making
it out to be. Having said that I realise the double loop is a little vile.
