"""
Two arrays of integers.

1. The elements of the first array are all factors of the integer being considered.
2. The "integer being considered" is a factor of all elements of the second array.


Factor is a an integer that divides into a whole number without a remainder.

2 is a factor of 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, etc
3 is a factor of 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, etc
4 is a factor if 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, etc

The function should return the number of integers that are between the sets.

Ok, this one perplexed me and I had to break out ChatGPT to understand it. If only the
question was phrased as find the lowest common multiple of items in a then the greatest
common divider of things in b and then count the intersection of the two.

Luckily, the MITx course has just been over recursive gcd algos using euclidian methods and
lcm algos, so it was just really a case of busting those out.
