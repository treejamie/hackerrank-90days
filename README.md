# [Hackerrank 90 days](https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/preparation-kits/three-month-preparation-kit/three-month-week-three/challenges)

## Why?

The 90 days worth of interview preparation on hackerrank. Public so that others may witness the learning and re-awakening of well rested neural pathways and the creation of new ones.

I'll working through the challenges in Python and then I'll be starting from scratch in Go, Elixir and TypeScript. Maybe even rust. I didn't start out with this aim, but that's how I ended up.  By the start of week five of doing them in Python I decided to use the challenges as a means of supporting my learning in other languages.

I don't think these challenges will make me a better programmer in themselves, but the act doing each one, in multiple languages probably will. 


## Structure

As I go back through the each week, there will be a directory called testcases and in each will be a textfile containing the documented `stdin` and the expected output. Hackerrank isn't consistent between returning values and printing them out, so my code here will always default to returning values as it makes testing much less finicky.

Until I'm back to week five the structure will be over the place, but once I've been through each week in Go it'll get cleaner.

The format for the test cases is stdin inputs seperated by newlines and then the expected output seperated by two newlines.

## Three Months?

Unlikley I will get through these in six months let alone three, so I'm not binding myself to any timeframe. Learning takes time and one of the things I am focused on right now is taking my programming up a level that I always aspired to when I saw it in others - to be language agnostic.

I'm not the best programmer on Earth, but I think I have the potential to be a pretty good one.
