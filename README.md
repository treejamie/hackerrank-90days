# hackerrank-90days
The 90 days worth of interview preparation on hackerrank. Public so that others may witness the learning and re-awakening of well rested neural pathways.

To be honest, I feel pretty exposed having this online, but meh, whatever. I am rusty. Having said that I always seem to come back stronger the second time around.

Also, I'm doing it over 180 days because I am also doing other things.

I am nothing if not a rule breaker.
