# [HackerRank 90 Days](https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/preparation-kits/three-month-preparation-kit/three-month-week-three/challenges)

This repoâ€™s layout isnâ€™t idiomatic to any one language â€” itâ€™s a mix of Elixir, Go, Python, and TypeScript.

Spot something I could improve? Open an issue and point it out â€” that would be swell.

## ðŸ™‹ Why?

The HackerRank 90-day course was designed as a three-month prep for recruitment pipelines. Whilst I started out with that intention, Iâ€™m not using it for that purpose anymore (_at least not directly_). Iâ€™m using it to apply my Python and Elixir knowledge to scaffold my development in Go and TypeScript.

What Iâ€™m noticing, though, is that itâ€™s also improving my authoring skills more broadly.

I started in January. At first, I just wanted to get through it in Python â€” a collection of scripts to store solutions. Then I added per-file unit testing. Then I started doing the challenges in different languages, and it evolved from there. Now itâ€™s basically a code dojo for me, where Iâ€™m free to pick a task and write it up in a bunch of languages.

Iâ€™ll be very pleased if I complete these challenges by the end of 2025 in four languages: Python, Elixir, Go, and TypeScript. The aim is to get a nice 25% language distribution across the repository and to demonstrate competence in basic project layout, standard libraries, testing methodologies, and â€” most importantly â€” low-complexity solutions.

For example, many challenges can be solved easily with an `O(n^2)` approach, but HackerRank will timeout when you submit inefficient code. Thatâ€™s a great forcing function â€” youâ€™re not allowed to be lazy.

## ðŸ§± Structure

The project is structured by **weeks**, not by language. That is: none of the projects follow idiomatic layouts for their respective languages.

Each week has a folder named `w1`, `w2`, etc. Inside each is a `tc` (_test cases_) folder, which contains test files in a very specific format. For example, hereâ€™s the test case data for a made-up challenge where youâ€™re given two integers and must sum them. Arguments are separated from expected output by two blank lines:

```plaintext
1 2

3
```

This format ensures each challenge across all languages consumes the same input/output.

## ðŸ“… Three Months?

This course was meant to be three months long, but Iâ€™m not treating it that way. Technically, youâ€™re supposed to use HackerRankâ€™s interface to author your code â€” but thatâ€™s a horrific experience.

If I finish all the challenges in four languages by the end of 2025, Iâ€™ll be very pleased.

## ðŸ˜± Idiomaticity

(_I made that word up_)

This repository is a mix of several languages, and Iâ€™ve prioritized their coexistence over idiomatic project layout. For example, the Elixir code isnâ€™t structured like a proper Mix project â€” same with TypeScript, Python, and Go.

The point is to compare approaches side by side, not to build polished, standalone apps.

That said, I still try to write idiomatic code within each languageâ€™s norms.

## ðŸ¤– LLM usage

### Code

None of the challenge solutions are directly written by AI. I do use LLMs while coding â€” theyâ€™re great scaffolds for learning.

### Documentation & Comments

Most comments were written by me and then passed through an LLM to make them more succinct. I tend to be overly wordy â€” LLMs are great at "neutral speak".


## âœ… Test & Quality

### Elixir

There are two quality checks ran on the challenges -  tests and static analysis.

Tests are handled with ExUnit:

```bash
mix test w*
```

Static analysis is done with Dialyzer:

```bash
mix compile
mix dialyzer
```

The main aim of using dialyzer is to get some practice in with being clear about `@spec`.

### Go

```bash
cd w1
go test -v
```

### TypeScript

```bash
pnpm vitest run
```


### Python

```bash
python -m unittest -v  */*_test.py
```
