You will be given a list of integers ($arr) and a single integer $k.

Create sublists of length $k from elements of $arr such that unfairness is minimised.

unfairness of a sublist ($x) is calculated as max($x) - min($x)

    You don't need to calculate all the permutations.

    Sorting the array list is enough so that the values are optimised
    to remove the need for calculating max(x) - min(x). This uses python
    internal timsort which is O(n log n).  The loop is O(n), which makes
    the sort the most intensive complexity.
